- Add a category filter
- Add a price filter
- Use `useContext` to avoid passing unnecessary props.

## Cart

- Make it possible to add products to the cart.
- Make it possible to remove products from the cart.
- Make it possible to modify the quantity of products in the cart.
- Synchronize the cart changes with the product list.
- Save the cart in `localStorage` so that it is recovered when the page is reloaded. (bonus points)
